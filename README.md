# Hardenizer

## Whats this

A tool for hardening windows 10 IPC using Siemens Guidelines.

Will create a pipeline to generate the unattender.xml to use with the file

## TODO:
- [ ] Add all tests
- [ ] Separate User Registries and System registries, might not be needed but i think its good to do.
- [ ] Make the test suite easier to write. PS1 file should just be the output of the program. Formatting it is better than hardcoding everything.
